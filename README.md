# Raspberry PI setup guide

## Install using Raspberry PI
You can install :

2. Connecting via SSH to the Raspberry Pi
3. Install LAMP
4. Install Node-Red
5. Install MQTT

## 2. Connecting via SSH to the Raspberry Pi
SSH (which stands for secure shell) is a method of establishing a communication with another computer securely. All data sent via SSH is encrypted. SSH is based on a Unix shell, so it allows you to access your Raspberry Pi files from a remote machine by using terminal commands.
To communicate with the Raspberry Pi via SSH, you need a software to handle SSH communication. We’ll use PuTTY. You need to install it on your computer if you haven’t already.
